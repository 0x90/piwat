The first request made is a HEAD one to bypass auth and deploy the malicious JSP, the second request is a GET one that triggers the reverse connection to the specified MSF listener.<br />Remember to run the MSF multi/handler listener with java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp as payload, in case you are using the reverse payload."
