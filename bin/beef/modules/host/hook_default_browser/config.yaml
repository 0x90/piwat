            description: "This module will use a PDF to attempt to hook the default browser (assuming it isn't currently hooked). <br><br>Normally, this will be IE but it will also work when Chrome is set to the default. When executed, the hooked browser will load a PDF and use that to start the default browser. If successful another browser will appear in the browser tree."
