            description: "Attempts to open closed ports on statefull firewalls and attempts to create pinholes on NAT-devices.  The firewall/NAT-device must support IRC connection tracking. BeEF will automatically bind a socket on port 6667 (IRC). Then you can connect to the victims public IP on that port.
