	# Has some issues, but overall it's pretty good
	# - printf(1) may not be available
	# - requires: "\x7c\x73\x68\x5c\x78"
	# - doesn't work on windows
	# - min size increase: 4x + 9
	# - max size increase: 4x + 14
	# However, because it intentionally leaves backslashes unescaped (assuming
	# that PHP's magic_quotes_gpc will take care of escaping them) it is
	# unsuitable for most exploits.

				left unescaped since it is assummed that PHP with magic_quotes_gpc
				enabled will escape them during request handling.
