The const_missing trick
=======================

Metasm uses a ruby trick to load most of the framework on demand, so that
*e.g.* the `MIPS`-related classes are never loaded in the ruby interpreter
unless you use them.

It is setup by the top-level `metasm.rb` file, by using the ruby mechanism of
`Module.autoload`. This mechanism will automatically load the specified metasm
components whenever a reference is made to one of the constants listed here.

Metasm provides a replacement top-level file, `misc/metasm-all.rb`,
which will unconditionally load all metasm files.
This will not however load mutually exclusive files, like the Gui subsystems ;
in this case it will load only the autodetected gui module (win32 or gtk).
