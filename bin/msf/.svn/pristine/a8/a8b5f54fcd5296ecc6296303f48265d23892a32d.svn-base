This project contains a set of assembly components for proof of concept codes
on different operating systems and architectures. These components were
carefully designed and implemented for maximum reliability, following strict
coding standards and requirements, such as system call invocation standards,
position independent, register independent and zero free code. A special
attention was put on code length when designing and implementing them,
resulting in the most reliable and shortest codes for such purpose available
today.
