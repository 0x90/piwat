      # XXX: This fixes the logic around whether a connection allocated is "fresh"

      # XXX: This allows the wait_timeout parameter in the database specification
      #      to use wall time vs a single @queue.wait() call to determine when
      #      it should look for an available connection. This is important with
      #      heavy threading and can be used to buffer spikes when a large number
      #      of threads need their own connection.

      # Check-out a database connection from the pool, indicating that you want
      # to use it. You should call #checkin when you no longer need this.
      #
      # This is done by either returning an existing connection, or by creating
      # a new connection. If the maximum number of connections for this pool has
      # already been reached, but the pool is empty (i.e. they're all being used),
      # then this method will wait until a thread has checked in a connection.
      # The wait time is bounded however: if no connection can be checked out
      # within the timeout specified for this pool, then a ConnectionTimeoutError
      # exception will be raised.
      #
      # Returns: an AbstractAdapter object.
      #
      # Raises:
      # - ConnectionTimeoutError: no connection can be obtained from the pool
      #   within the timeout period.
