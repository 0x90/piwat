= Intro
=======

EPiServer is a popular webbased content management system from Elektropost (http://www.episerver.com).
You can dump the password hashes using the SQL syntax "select name, salt, hash from tblSID". The tblSID
tabel stores interesting things such as usernames, salt and password hashes, but also passwords in cleartext.
If a password can be found in cleartext it is found in the password column of tblSID.

= Install
=========

Copy the epibf_X.Y-john_1.7.2.patch (where X and Y needs to be replaced with the version you downloaded)
to your john source directory, e.g. john-1.7.2/src and then run "patch -p2 < epibf_X.Y-john_1.7.2.patch" (remember the X and Y).
The patch will create a file called EPI_fmt.c, some files for SHA1 support as well as update some of johns
files in order to incorporate the patch with john.

= Usage
=======

This patch needs the format of the password file to be: <user>:<salt> <hash>. (Currently you need to include
an inital 0x of both salt and hash.)

-------------- End --------------------------

You can then run "john epipasswd", the format will be autodetected.
In case you'd like to check the performance of the patch try "john --test --format:epi".
