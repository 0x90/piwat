This directory contains the win32 payload development environment used
for creating the payloads in version 3 of the Metasploit Framework.

The 'nasm' executable must be in your path to use the included build.sh tool.

The included 'build' script automatically creates a number of file types
each time it used to compile a payload. These file types are:

    - Native ELF executable
    - Win32 PE executable
    - Generated C source code
    - Raw opcodes in ".bin" format

The PE executable templates were developed by 'rix' and used with permission.

To use this script, simply run ./build.sh <name of payload>, where the name
does not include the ".asm" suffix. To build win32_stage_api.asm, the 
command line would be "./build.sh win32_stage_api".
