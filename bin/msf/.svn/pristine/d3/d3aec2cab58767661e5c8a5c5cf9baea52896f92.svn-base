The Metasm framework documentation
==================================

Metasm
------

The Metasm framework is an opensource software designed to interact with
the various forms of binary code. It is written in pure Ruby
(<http://ruby-lang.org/>).

More detailed informations can be found in the <feature_list.txt>.

It is distributed freely under the terms of the LGPL.

Documentation organisation
--------------------------

This documentation is split in different parts :

* the <core_classes.txt>
* the major <use_cases.txt>
* <code_organisation.txt>

The first part describes the internal structure of the framework, the
second part is a higher level overview of the software and shows how
the various parts are used and can interract. The last part explains
the role of the source files and directories.


Documentation progress
----------------------

The documentation is written here and there in my free time, and is **very**
**incomplete** as of now. Specifically, all internal links you'll find
ending in `.txt` are link to pages that have not been written yet.
