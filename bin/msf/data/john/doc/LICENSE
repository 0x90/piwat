As the copyright holder for the bcrypt (Blowfish-based password hashing)
implementation found in John the Ripper, I have placed a derived version
of this implementation in the public domain.  This derived version may
be obtained at:

The intent is to provide modern password hashing for your servers and
your software (where the GPL restrictions could be a problem).

Additionally, I have placed the CRC-32 implementation (crc32.c, crc32.h)
in the public domain.


	Commercial licensing.

Commercial licenses (non-GPL) are available upon request.
