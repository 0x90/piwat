== 1.4.8 - 16-Jan-2011
* A binary for both 1.8.x and 1.9.x is now shipped as part of the binary
  build. A stub file is used to dynamically require the correct binary based
  on your current version of Ruby.
* Some updates to the Rakefile to help build multiple binaries.

== 1.4.7 - 4-Dec-2010
* An internal error formatting function now resorts to the default
  LANGID on error 1815 (ERROR_RESOURCE_LANG_NOT_FOUND). Thanks go to
  Little Snake for the spot.
* Added a default Rake task and refactored the clean task.

== 1.4.6 - 9-Feb-2010
* Fixed a warning that showed up with MinGW/gcc caused by an unnecessary
  pointer dereference.
* Some updates to the Rakefile and gemspec. Gem building is now handled via
  Rake tasks.
* Minor updates to the test suite.

== 1.4.5 - 24-Aug-2009
* Reverted the change in 1.4.4. We need unsigned longs in a few cases.
  Consequently, you should upgrade windows-pr to 1.0.8 or later because
  some return values were set to -1 instead of 0xFFFFFFFF as they are now.
* Updated one test to validate return value from failed function.

== 1.4.4 - 18-Aug-2009
* Fixed a bug where functions that returned a long return type were unsigned
  instead of signed.
* The Rakefile has been refactored somewhat, including the removal of FFI
  related tasks. Those are now in a separate branch in the repository.
* The test-unit library is now a development dependency instead of a runtime
  dependency.

== 1.4.3 - 23-Jun-2009
* Bug fix for mingw.
* License now set to Artistic 2.0.

== 1.4.2 - 31-May-2009
* Updated the internal StringError() function to better handle the possibility
  of the English .mui file not being found. Thanks go to Michel Demazure for
  the spot.

== 1.4.1 - 29-May-2009
* Callback handling improvements.
* Updated the gemspec description.

== 1.4.0 - 19-Feb-2009
* Now compatible with Ruby 1.9.x.
* In what will go down as, "It seemed like a good idea at the time", I have
  removed the feature where W (wide) character functions were used first if
  your $KCODE environment variable was set to "UTF8". It caused too many
  headaches in practice, especially amongst Rails users. You must now always
  explicitly specify 'W' in the constructor if that's what you want.
* Fixed RF bug #23944 - bad error message for MSVCRT functions that failed
  to load properly.

== 1.3.0 - 1-Jan-2009
* Fixed RubyForge bug #23395, which was caused by inadvertently modifying
  a variable within a loop. This caused callbacks to fail in certain
  situations.
* Added the Win32::API::LoadLibraryError and Win32::API::PrototypeError classes
  to provide more fine grained handling of possible error conditions in the
  constructor. These are both subclasses of Win32::API::Error.
* Removed the Win32::API::CallbackError class.
* Changed the upper limit on prototypes from 16 to 20. It turns out that
  there are actually Windows functions with more than 16 prototypes.
* Refactored a high iteration test so that it counts as only one test
  instead of 1000.

== 1.2.2 - 27-Nov-2008
* Fixed bug in the error message for illegal prototypes and illegal return
  types where the character in question would come out as empty or garbage.
* Passing a bad return type to Win32::API::Callback now raises an error.
* Updated the error message for illegal return types to say, "Illegal return
  type" instead of "Illegal prototype" as it did previously.
* The error message for a bad function name passed to Win32::API.new now
  matches JRuby's FFI error message.
* Improved the handling of msvcrt functions with regards to skipping 'A'
  and 'W' checks. Previously it was checking against the literal string
  'msvcrt'. Now it checks against any string that starts with 'msvcr'.
* Added test-unit 2.x as a prerequisite.
* Added tests for the Win32::API::Callback#address method.
* Added tests to all Win32::API classes that explicitly check error messages.

== 1.2.1 - 14-Nov-2008
* Fixed and updated callback handling.
* Fixed wide string return handling for pointers and strings.
* Added the Win32::API::Callback#address instance method.
* All errors are now in English instead of your native language, because
  that's what Ruby itself does.

== 1.2.0 - 22-Jul-2008
* Added support for the 'S' (string) prototype and return type. It can be
  used instead of 'P' (pointer) for const char*.
* Some internal refactoring. The attempts to load ANSI and/or Wide character
  versions of functions are skipped for MSVCRT functions, since they do not
  exist. This eliminates some unnecessary LoadLibrary() calls.
* Added a couple of gem building Rake tasks.
* Added a few more tests.

== 1.1.0 - 12-Jun-2008
* Added the Windows::API::Function class. This is a subclass of Win32::API
  meant only for use with raw function pointers.
* Some documentation updates in the source and README files.

== 1.0.6 - 18-Apr-2008
* Added the effective_function_name method. This allows you to see what the
  actual function name is that was defined, e.g. GetUserNameA vs GetUserNameW.
* Replaced an instance of _tcscmp with strcmp. The case in question was always
  going to be ASCII.
* Cleaned up some -W3 warnings.
* Added the build_manifest task to the Rakefile, which is automatically run if
  you're using a version of Ruby built with VC++ 8 or later. This builds a
  ruby.exe.manifest file (if it doesn't already exist).

== 1.0.5 - 20-Nov-2007
* The API.new method now defaults to "W" (wide character functions) before "A"
  (ANSI functions) if the $KCODE global variable is set to 'u' (UTF8).
* Minor improvements to the Rakefile.

== 1.0.4 - 26-Oct-2007
* Fixed a bug where methods that returned pointers ('P') could choke if the
  resulting pointer was 0 or NULL. In this case, nil is now returned instead.
* Tweak to the extconf.rb file that helps the gem build it from source
  properly.

== 1.0.3 - 28-Sep-2007
* Fixed a subtle but dangerous copy-on-write bug in the API#call method.

== 1.0.2 - 28-Sep-2007
* Fixed a bug in an internal struct member that was causing segfaults. Thanks
  go to Lars Olsson for the spot.
* Fixed the 'install' task in the Rakefile. This only affected native builds,
  not the prebuilt binary.
* Added a few more tests.

== 1.0.1 - 27-Sep-2007
* Functions declared with a void prototype no longer require an explicit nil
  argument to fulfill the arity requirement. You can still call them with an
  explicit nil if you wish, however.
* Fixed the gemspec for the native build.

== 1.0.0 - 14-Sep-2007
* Initial release
